# MarathonTrainer

Running has become the new hot topic.<br>
Since the ultimate challenge for runners is to conquer a marathon, we want to create a model that can help train runners, and help them predict their running result using real-time updating data.<br>

In this project, we utilized several different machine learning models, and select the with the best performance, evaluated by comparing prediction scores.<br>

By checking the running time of every 5K, we can predict the estimated run time of the following 5K.<br>

The data of runners in the famous Boston marathon.<br>
